Part number:		INTEGRALSTICK v0.1

General fabrication notes

	* Boards are be individually routed.
	* Board material is Isola 370HR
	* Blue LPI solder mask on both sides of board. All vias to be tented.
	* White LPI legend on both sides of board.
	* Pad finish is ENIG.
	* Finished board thickness is 1.6 mm.
	* Electrical testing requested.
	* The small soldermask apertures over traces are test points.
	* Place UL mark and date code in the area marked on the "F. Fab" gerber layer.

Impedances

	Control to within 10%.

	Layer 1 microstrip (ref to layer 2 ground)
		175 μm trace = 50 ohm single ended
		165 μm trace / 100 μm space = 100 ohm differential

	Layer 4 microstrip (ref to layer 3 power plane)
		175 μm trace = 50 ohm single ended
		165 μm trace / 100 μm space = 100 ohm differential

	The 100 μm traces and 125 μm/100 μm differential pairs are used for fan-out only,
	and do not need to be impedance controlled.
